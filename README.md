# Socket-Java-Text-Chat
Socket.IO is a realtime javascript library for bidirectional communication.It supports multiple platforms.
Using JavaSwing I build 2 GUI and using java.net.socket package of java demonstrated the data exchange between client and server .
One GUI is client and other GUI is server.Internal in code it is hard coded about listening in which port.
